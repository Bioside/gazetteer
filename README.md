Main purpose of this project is easy to use geocoder/geoindexer.

Project consists of two parts: Gazetteer and GazetteerWeb

Gazetteer
=========

Gazetteer used to parse OSM data and do all dirty work with geometry.

You can use Gazetteer as standalone OSM processor, to dump addresses from OSM. You can ignore GazetteerWeb and use data in your own geocoding/geosearching applications.

GazetteerWeb
============

GazetteerWeb is a second part of online geocode service. It uses ElasticSearch and RestExpress to provide an api to search among the data generated by Gazetteer.
